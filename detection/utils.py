            "into more serious conditions. Early detection allows for minimal intervention, which is often "
            "more effective and less invasive than treatment for advanced lesions."),
            
        1: ("bbps-2-3: These lesions are of intermediate complexity and may require closer monitoring. "
            "They can indicate potential progression of underlying issues and necessitate further diagnostic "
            "evaluation to rule out malignancy. In some cases, these lesions might show atypical features, "
            "suggesting a need for more comprehensive imaging or biopsy to assess their nature and determine "

        3: ("dyed-lifted-polyps: These polyps have been enhanced with dye for better visualization during "
            "endoscopic procedures. The dye helps delineate the edges and morphology of polyps, allowing for more "

            "This positioning can complicate the visualization of gastric lesions during endoscopy. Careful examination is "

            "Patients may experience symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. Management typically involves "
            "anti-inflammatory medications and regular monitoring to prevent progression of the disease."),
